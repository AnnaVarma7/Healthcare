🌫️ Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis – Delhi, January 2023
This project analyzes hourly air quality data for Delhi in January 2023 to evaluate pollution levels, identify key pollutant contributors, and derive health-oriented insights using Python.

🎯 Objective
Calculate AQI based on pollutant concentrations using standard breakpoints
Categorize AQI levels and visualize temporal trends
Analyze pollutant contribution, correlations, and peak pollution hours
Derive actionable insights for environmental health monitoring

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python
Pandas – Data preprocessing & aggregation
Plotly – Interactive time series and categorical visualizations

📁 Dataset Overview
File: delhiaqi.csv
Hourly readings of pollutants:
co, no, no2, o3, so2, pm2_5, pm10, nh3

Timestamp column: date

🧪 Methodology
1. Preprocessing
Converted timestamps to datetime format
Extracted features like hour, day of week

2. AQI Calculation
Used EPA-based AQI breakpoints
For each row, AQI = max AQI among all pollutants

Categorized AQI into:
Good
Moderate
Unhealthy (for Sensitive Groups)
Very Unhealthy
Hazardous

3. Visual Explorations
Time-series trends of individual pollutants
Bar plots of AQI over time and by category
Donut chart of pollutant contributions
Correlation heatmap of pollutants
AQI trends by hour and day of the week

📈 Key Findings
PM2.5 and PM10 are the most dominant pollutants in Delhi’s air during January.
AQI levels were consistently in the Very Unhealthy to Hazardous range.
Wednesdays and Thursdays had the worst air quality.
Strong positive correlations observed between CO, NO, NO2, SO2, PM2.5, PM10, suggesting common sources (e.g., vehicle emissions).
O3 showed a negative correlation with other pollutants, reflecting its distinct atmospheric behavior.
